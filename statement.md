🔹 Problem Statement

Understanding whether a sentence expresses a positive or negative emotion can be useful in many applications such as product reviews, feedback analysis, and social media monitoring. Manual classification is time-consuming and inconsistent. Therefore, a simple automated system is needed to classify the sentiment of a user-entered sentence quickly and accurately.

🔹 Scope of the Project

The system processes short user-entered sentences.
It classifies the sentiment into Positive or Negative using a basic machine-learning model.
It uses a small predefined dataset for training.
The project focuses on simplicity, making it suitable for academic learning and demonstrations.
The scope does not include advanced NLP tasks like sarcasm detection, neutral sentiment, or large-scale datasets.
